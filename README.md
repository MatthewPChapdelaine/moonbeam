========

Moonbeam is an online metaverse in-world content scraping directory to help users find stores and products. Scripted agents (bot avatars) visit in-world stores and gather object name, description, location and land information and contribute to a publically searchable database so that customers can easily find products that are not also listed on an online marketplace.
